Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

There are three essential data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, and booleans.
  
  We can write out anything to the console with console.log.
  
  We can do math with operators like +, -, *, and /.
  
  We can find the remainder after dividing two numbers with a modulus: %.
  
  We can generate a random number with Math.random, then make it a whole number with Math.floor.
  
  We write a single line comment with // and a multi-line comment with /* and */.
  
You've just finished one of the toughest parts of this course, nice work!
