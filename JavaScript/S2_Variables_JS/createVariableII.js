/*
If variables can hold strings, can they hold other data types? Let's give it a shot:

  var myAge = 15;
  var likesChocolate = true;

  console.log(myAge);
  // Output: 15

  console.log(likesChocolate);
  // Output: true

Variables can hold any data type, like strings, numbers, and Booleans. They can also hold data types that we have not learned yet, like arrays, functions and objects (more on that later).

Instructions

1.
Under the strength variable, create a new variable named age and set it equal to your age as a number.

2.
Under your age variable, use console.log to print it to the console.

3.
Now, create another variable named hasPet, and set it equal to a boolean.

Then, print it to the console with console.log.

4.
Way to go! Variables are able to hold any kind of data type.

*/

var strength = '50,000 pounds';
var age = 24;
var hasPet = true;

console.log(age);
// Output: 24

console.log(hasPet);
// Output: True

console.log('How much stuff can a variable hold?', strength);
// Output: 50,000 pounds
